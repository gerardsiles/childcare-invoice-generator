## Overview

## My process

- After learning more about the versatility of React-Router-DOM, I decided to apply this knowledge to a small project I had recently completed.

- I began by using the createBrowserRouter object to define my Outlet, loaders, path to the Dashboard, an Error page and an action to be able to logout.


### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router-DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [JSX](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Toastify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge of mapping through data and using conditional statements to create a reliable user experience. 

I learnt how to use key features of the React-Router-DOM, such as _action.

### Continued development

The next steps are to:
- Finish error handling
- Implement the facility to print, download, and share a professional looking invoice

After this, I intend to make the app a completed full-stack project, where the data will be stored in a database and users can log in and save data.
